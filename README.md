# Palm-Print-Identification-System

## Introduction
 In community settings, such as universities, traditional biometric recognition systems that
 require physical contact pose hygiene concerns and face scalability challenges in high-traffic areas, such
 as lecture halls and classrooms. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-driven, contactless
 palm print recognition system

The platform features a system where student authentication is achieved through palm print biometric verification. Staff members are the primary users, handling functions like palm print registration, recognition, result retrieval, and log review. Administrators manage the system, overseeing staff accounts and maintaining student information.
